# ap_convex_hull

C++ program to compute the Convex Hull of a set of points using Andrew's and QuickHull algorithms. 
Points can be generated randomly or imported from a file. 
Two modes are available: a graphical step-by-step mode and a fast calculation mode.

## Requirements
* SFML Library for graphical output (SFML 2.6.1)
* GCC Compiler: We recommend GCC 13.1.0 MinGW (DW2) - 32-bit
* CMake: Used for building the project


## Installation
* Install CMake
* Build the program with cmake.  
CMake will automatically download and configure SFML.

## Executable

The executable file is located at:
